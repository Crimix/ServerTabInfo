# Server Tab Info
[Server Tab Info](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/server-tab-info) is a small server utility mod that displays mean tick time and tps information on a nice elegant way. The inspiration came from a small feature from [MineTogether](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/creeperhost-minetogether) which used to work quite nice for me, but lately failed to work, therefore I create this mod.
